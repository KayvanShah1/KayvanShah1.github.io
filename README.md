# üíº Kayvan Shah | Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, showcasing work in data engineering, MLOps, machine learning, and creative coding. Built with a modern stack, the site blends technical expertise with visual storytelling ‚Äî featuring interactive animations and detailed project documentation.

## üß© Key Features

* **Responsive, Minimal Design** ‚Äî Tailored for both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Tabbed Experience Section** ‚Äî Cleanly displays multi-role and multi-company timelines.
* **Projects & Education** ‚Äî Highlights academic background and impactful engineering contributions.
* **Web3Forms Contact** ‚Äî Easy-to-use, spam-free form handling.
* **Creative Visuals** ‚Äî Includes custom interactive sketches like the circuit tree (p5.js + WebGL).

## üåü Visual Highlight

**Recursive Electric Circuit Tree**
A dynamic, interactive visualization of recursive circuit-style trees built using `p5.js` with `WebGL` and rendered inside a React component using `p5-wrapper`. The animation features smooth branch growth, shine propagation, tree sway on user interaction, shine reset, and saving a snapshot of the tree and regrowth of tree.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

All key animation parameters are exposed and can be tweaked, including:

* `maxDepth`, `maxBranchesPerNode`
* `shineSpeed`, `growthDelay`, `childDelay`, `growthDuration`
* `treeScale`, `swayDecayDuration`

These allow experimentation with different tree behaviors and styles.

### üñ±Ô∏è Interactions

* **Left Click:** Triggers a sway based on click location
* **Timed Shine:** Pulses from the tree center periodically
* **Tree Charging:** Brief glow effect before shine

## üõ† Tech Stack

* React + TypeScript + Vite
* TailwindCSS / ShadCN UI
* p5.js (WebGL)
* Web3Forms for contact handling
* GitHub Pages for deployment
